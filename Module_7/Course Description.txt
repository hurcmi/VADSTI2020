Module 7: Tools for Applied Data Science Using Cloud-Based Platform
Instructor: NHGRI AnVIL Team & NIH-CIT STRIDES Team
Description: 
The AnVIL (http://anvilproject.org/) is a cloud-based platform that supports the management, analysis and sharing of biomedical data for the NHGRI research community. It aims to advance our basic understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits and accelerate discovery and development of therapies, diagnostic tests, and other technologies for diseases like cardiovascular disease or autism spectrum disorders. The platform currently hosts more than 75,000 whole human genome data sets, and offers a variety of analysis capabilities including: Terra for large scale batch computing and interactive computing; Gen3 for managing, analyzing, harmonizing, and sharing large datasets; DockStore for sharing Docker-based analysis workflows; Jupyter notebooks for organizing live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text into a single document; R Studio for interactive machine learning, statistical computing, and visualizations; Bioconductor for community-driven interactive genomics with R; and Galaxy, for accessible, reproducible, and transparent genomic science. In this module, you will be introduced to the platform, tools and functionality for data science projects.
