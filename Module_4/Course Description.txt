Module 4: Cluster Analysis
Instructor: Martin Skarzynski, PhD
Description:
Module 4 will discuss
- Clustering
- Similarity measures / Distance metrics
- k-means algorithm
- hierarchical clustering.

Clustering, a type of unsupervised machine learning, uses input data to group similar data points together. In the VADSTI cluster analysis module, we will practice applying different clustering algorithms and optimizing their performance. Importantly, we will also learn how to interpret clustering results through data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and decision trees. Upon completion of the module, course participants will be able to produce insights from data by combining clustering with other important data science techniques.
